## Bio ! :dolphin:
**Having an ethereal self I love to inspire others. while at the same time I learn a lot of new things from them. By my iota of experience from teaching, volunteering, and leading camps I had a judicious ego which is more flexible to consider all the aspects of a team task. 
I have the skill to make people feel their knowledge and time are worthy. I want them to love, live and laugh and spread the jubilance where ever they go." Throw me to the wolves and I will return leading the pack."**
